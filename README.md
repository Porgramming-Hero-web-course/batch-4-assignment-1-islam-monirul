#### Author: Monirul Islam

### Problems:

1. Write a TypeScript function sumArray that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of all elements in the array.

2. Create a TypeScript function removeDuplicates that accepts an array of numbers and returns a new array with duplicates removed. Preserve the original order of elements.

3. Create a TypeScript function called countWordOccurrences that accepts a sentence (string) and a word (string). The function should return the number of times the word appears in the sentence, ignoring case. Use the simple sentence without punctuation as input.

4. Define a union type Circle and Rectangle, where each type has a unique shape property. Create a function calculateShapeArea that uses type guards to calculate the area based on the shape type.

5. Write a generic function getProperty that takes an object and a property name as arguments and returns the property value. Add a constraint to ensure the property name exists on the object.

6. Define an interface Profile with properties name, age, and email. Create a function updateProfile that accepts an object of type Profile and an object of type Partial representing the updates. The function should return the updated profile.

7. Create a TypeScript class Car with properties make, model, and year. Include a method getCarAge that returns the car's age based on the current year.

8. Create a function validateKeys(obj: T, keys: (keyof T)[]) that takes an object obj and an array of keys keys. The function should return true if all of the specified keys exist in the object; otherwise, it should return false.
